How fast is your website? Start seeing real performance data from your site's actual visitors with Torbit Insight!

== Description ==

**Real User Measurement (RUM)** is what Torbit Insight is all about.

**How fast is your website?**
Torbit Insight is a new service that allows you to see how fast your website is loading using real user measurement. Using our small JavaScript snippet, you can find the time it takes your site to load for *every visitor* on *every page*.

**The business case for speed**
It's intuitive - the longer your site takes to load, the more people are going to click the back button. Insight is the tool that explains why you should invest in performance at your company. Finally, you have a way to quantify exactly how much speed matters for your business. 

**The metrics you care about**
With performance data, it's important to look beyond averages since there are so many inevitable outliers. Insight allows you to look at other key metrics like your median, 90th, 95th and 99th percentiles.

**Real visitor data**
See a histogram showing the breakdown of your site speed and get a better sense of the typical experience for your visitors. With 100% sampling, you'll get valuable performance data for *every visitor* on *every page*.

**Real time feedback**
Did that latest code deployment make you faster or slower? By tracking your performance in real time, you can see how your speed is changing as new features are added to your site. With *1-second resolution*, you have instant transparency into how your site is performing at any given moment.

**Spot performance issues right away**
With our live map view you can see the loading times your visitors are experiencing right now and spot any performance issues that may be affecting a particular region.

**And a whole lot more....**
